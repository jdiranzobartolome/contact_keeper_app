# Contact Keeper Web App
Contact keeper full stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js) based application that allows the user to register, login/logout and manage a list of contacts.
After being authenticated, the user can add, delete or update contacts, which are stored on the database 
and which can be reached only by that same user (users cannot see other users' contact lists). Jason Web Tokens (JWT) are 
used for adding the authorization features to the back-end.
